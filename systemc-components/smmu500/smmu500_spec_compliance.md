# SMMU-500 Model Specification Compliance Report

Reference: ARM DDI 0517 (CoreLink MMU-500 TRM), ARM IHI 0062 (SMMUv2 Architecture Specification)

## 1. Summary

This model implements a functional subset of the ARM MMU-500 sufficient for
AArch64 LPAE page table walks (stage 1, stage 2, and nested stage 1+2), stream
matching, TLB invalidation via DMI, and global address translation services.
Only registers with associated behavioral logic are explicitly declared in the
model; all other registers in the SMMU address space (identification, debug,
performance monitors, etc.) are accessible as memory via the reg_model_maker
ZIP configuration.

`tests/components/smmu500`. The tests cover stream matching, S2CR bypass/fault
handling, global and context fault status, W1C behavior, GATS operations,
stage-1 and stage-2 translations, nested translation, fault syndrome recording,
TBU read/write/debug forwarding, DMI range handling, and TLBI-triggered DMI
invalidation.

## 3. Features Not Covered

### 3.1 Global Fault Behavior

The model implements ICF, USF, and SMCF for stream-mapping transactions. ICF is
reported and rejects the transaction when a matched S2CR selects TYPE=0b10
(Fault), TYPE is reserved, or the selected CBNDX is outside the implemented
context-bank range. Secure transactions record SGFSR status and non-secure
transactions record NSGFSR status. `irq_global` is asserted when either bank
has a pending fault with its corresponding GFIE enabled. Both status banks are
write-1-to-clear.
GATS requests with a context-bank index outside `p_num_cb` also report ICF and
return `GPAR.F = 1`.

Configuration-access faults (`SGFSR.CAF`) and their `SCR0.GCFGFRE/GCFGFIE`
reporting paths remain unsupported because the generic register target does not
currently expose security/access metadata needed to identify disallowed
configuration accesses.

### 3.2 S2CR TYPE Field

The S2CR.TYPE field (bits [17:16]) is checked:

- TYPE=0b00 (Translation): Use the selected context bank
- TYPE=0b01 (Bypass): Pass transactions without translation
- TYPE=0b10 (Fault): Generate an Invalid Context Fault
- TYPE=0b11 (Reserved): Treated as an Invalid Context Fault

### 3.3 Write-1-to-Clear (W1C) Semantics

SGFSR and NSGFSR ICF, USF, and SMCF implement independent write-1-to-clear
behavior. CB_FSR fault status bits also implement write-1-to-clear semantics;
clearing the last fault deasserts the context IRQ. The FSRRESTORE companion
registers have no special relationship to FSR.

### 3.4 Read-Only / Write-Only Register Enforcement

Read-only and write-only register access semantics are partially enforced.
IDR0/1/2/7 are restored from model configuration after writes, and implemented
TLBI command registers are cleared after writes. The remaining register set does
not generally enforce architectural RO/WO access policy.

### 3.5 Context Fault Syndrome Details

The model classifies synchronous translation failures into the context-bank FSR
status bits:

- `TF`: malformed descriptors, disabled walks, and ordinary translation faults
- `AFF`: access-flag failures
- `PF`: stage-1 or stage-2 permission failures
- `EF`: external errors while fetching translation-table descriptors
- `ASF`: output-address-size or canonical-address failures
- `MULTI`: set when a new fault is recorded while another FSR fault bit is latched

For the first fault, `CB_FSYNR0` records the walk level, write/read direction,
privileged/unprivileged state, instruction/data state, security state,
address-translation-operation state, page-table-walk-fault state, asynchronous
recording state, and stage-1 context-bank index. Nested stage-2 faults that
occur while fetching stage-1 descriptors are reported to the stage-1 context as
page-table-walk faults, with IPAFAR set to the descriptor IPA. `CB_FSYNR1`
records MID/PID/BID when the `smmu500_transaction_attrs_extension` is attached;
otherwise those fields default to zero.
The first fault's FAR/IPAFAR and syndrome are preserved when `MULTI` is set.

### 3.6 Security State Differentiation

`gs::QemuMemTxAttrsTlmExtension` carries QEMU `MemTxAttrs` fields for
QEMU-to-QBox transactions. The SMMU consumes only its security-state field;
all other QEMU attributes do not affect SMMU translation or fault reporting.
`QemuInitiatorSocket` attaches it for QEMU memory accesses. The optional
`gs::smmu500_transaction_attrs_extension` carries the remaining request
attributes: privilege level, instruction/data access, address translation
operation, asynchronous state, and MID/PID/BID syndrome fields. When both are
present, the QEMU transaction-attributes extension is authoritative for
security state. The
implemented GATS registers are secure-bank operations, so their page-table
walks and context-fault syndrome use the secure state; GATS1P*/GATS1U* select
the privilege state.

When an ordinary TLM transaction has no such extension, the model defaults to
a privileged, non-secure data access. This is a compatibility policy: it does
not prove that the originating requester was privileged, and therefore cannot
report an unprivileged-access permission fault for an unannotated transaction.
Translation, access-flag, read/write permission, external-walk, and
address-size faults remain independently checked.

The CPU or interconnect bridge is responsible for attaching request attributes
at the TBU ingress. For AXI-like request attributes, the intended mapping is:

- `AxPROT[0]` (unprivileged) -> `privileged = false`
- `AxPROT[1]` (secure) -> `QemuMemTxAttrsTlmExtension::secure = true`
- instruction/data indication -> `instruction`

Security-tagged register accesses are checked at the SMMU register socket.
Secure accesses can reach the complete register model. Non-secure accesses are
restricted to the NS global window, the `SCR1.NSNUMSMRGO`-assigned SMR/S2CR
slots, and the `SCR1.NSNUMCBO`-assigned CBAR/CBA2R/context-bank resources.
An unannotated TLM request retains the legacy unrestricted compatibility
behavior. `smmuv3_memory_attrs_extension` is not a substitute for the SMMU500
request extension because it carries attributes derived from page-table
descriptors rather than requester privilege.

### 3.7 VMID Support

- VMID matching in S2CR is not implemented
- VMID-based global TLB invalidation is implemented conservatively for DMI
  ranges by invalidating context banks whose CBAR.VMID matches the command VMID
- 16-bit VMID (SCR0.VMID16EN, CBA2R.VMID) is not used

### 3.8 Per-CB TLB Invalidation by VA

CB_TLBIVA, CB_TLBIVAA, CB_TLBIVAL, CB_TLBIVAAL, CB_TLBIIPAS2, and
CB_TLBIIPAS2L are implemented as conservative per-CB DMI invalidations. The
model does not maintain a VA/IPA-tagged TLB, so these commands invalidate all
tracked DMI for the addressed context bank rather than a precise VA/IPA entry.

### 3.9 Global TLB Invalidation

Global TLB invalidation operations (STLBIALL, TLBIVMID, TLBIALLNSNH, TLBIALLH,
TLBIVMIDS1, and 64-bit VA variants) are implemented as conservative DMI
invalidations. The model does not maintain architectural TLB entries, so
address-specific commands invalidate broader DMI state than hardware would.

### 3.10 Transaction Stalling

- CB_SCTLR.CFCFG (stall vs terminate on fault) is not checked
- CB_RESUME has no logic — stalled transactions cannot be resumed
- CB_FSR.SS (stalled status) is never set
- SCR0.STALLD / GSE are not used

### 3.11 GATS Limitations

All eight GATS operations are implemented as translation requests:
- GATS1PR, GATS1PW, GATS12PR, GATS12PW
- GATS1UR, GATS1UW, GATS12UR, GATS12UW

The model uses the operation variant to select privileged versus unprivileged
permission checks and read versus write permission checks. The result is written
to GPAR/GPAR_H. Invalid context-bank indices return `GPAR.F = 1` and set
`SGFSR.ICF`.

### 3.12 AArch32 Short-Descriptor Format

Only the AArch64 LPAE (Long Descriptor) page table format is implemented.
The AArch32 Short-Descriptor format (used when CBA2R.VA64=0 and the CB is
configured for 32-bit virtual addresses) is **not supported**.

### 3.13 Memory Attributes

- MAIR0/MAIR1 (PRRR/NMRR) are stored but not used during translation
- Descriptor memory attributes are not propagated to the translated transaction
- SCR0 shareability/cacheability overrides (SHCFG, RACFG, WACFG, MEMATTR,
  MTCFG) are not applied
- CB_SCTLR cacheability/shareability fields are not used

---

## 4. Implementation Differences from Spec

### 4.1 TBU Transport Encoding

The TBU accepts an integration-specific transport encoding:
```
tbu_id          = topology_id[14:10]
topo_id         = topology_id[9:5]
configured_csid = topology_id[3:0]
```
The integration provides `topology_id` as a 15-bit base SID. For TBU traffic
whose address is below 64 GiB, address bits [35:32] carry an optional CSID. A
nonzero carried CSID replaces `configured_csid`; otherwise the configured CSID
is retained. The model composes the matched stream ID as:
```
master_id = (tbu_id << 10) | (topo_id << 5) | selected_csid
```
For that legacy carrier form, the IOVA passed to the page-table walk is limited
to 32 bits. A TBU address at or above 64 GiB has no carrier: its full address
is retained as the IOVA and its configured CSID is used. A selected context
with `CBA2R.VA64=0` also constrains the walk input to 32 bits. The resulting SID
is matched exactly against the programmed SMR entries. An unresolved SID
follows the configured unidentified-stream behavior; it is not rewritten to
another programmed CSID.

This encoding is not an architectural SMMU interface; the ARM interface
provides the StreamID and IOVA independently. The core validates the decoded
IOVA against TTBR0 or TTBR1 according to the architecture. Direct translations
and GATS operations preserve their full 64-bit input address.

### 4.2 SMMU Bypass Behavior

When SCR0.CLIENTPD=1, the model returns `addr_mask = -1` (full bypass,
identity mapping). For an unmatched stream, SCR0.USFCFG controls whether the
stream faults: when set, USF is recorded and the transaction is rejected; when
clear, the transaction bypasses without recording USF. For multiple matches,
SCR0.SMCFCFG controls whether SMCF is recorded and rejected; when clear, the
first matching S2CR action is used. There is no software parameter override for
these architectural controls.

Stage-1 input addresses are checked against the selected TTBR0 or TTBR1 range.
Out-of-range or non-canonical addresses raise CB_FSR.ASF.

### 4.3 Fault Handling

The model classifies the main synchronous translation fault types into
CB_FSR.TF, AFF, PF, EF, and ASF, records first-fault syndrome state, and latches
CB_FSR.MULTI on later faults. It does not model stalled-fault delivery or
resume behavior, and FSRRESTORE remains storage-only.

### 4.4 Security-Banked Global Fault Handling

SMMU500 selects SCR0/SGFSR for secure transactions and NSCR0/NSGFSR for
non-secure transactions before checking CLIENTPD or stream-mapping controls.
The security state is also retained on internal page-table-walk DMA
transactions. QEMU maps transaction attributes to an IOMMU index and QBox
keeps DMI mappings separate for each index, so Secure and Non-secure requests
may use DMI even when their translation controls differ. Writes to either
control register invalidate already granted TBU DMI ranges.

### 4.5 No TLB Caching in TCU

The model performs a full page table walk on every translation. There is no TLB
cache in the TCU (Translation Control Unit). Only the TBU-side DMI mechanism
provides translation caching. This is functionally correct but differs from
hardware which caches translations in both TBU micro-TLBs and TCU main TLB.

### 4.6 GATS Input Format

The model encodes the GATS input as:
```
va = value & ~0xFFF
cb = value & 0xFFF
```
This uses the lower 12 bits for the context bank index and the upper bits for
the VA. If the decoded context bank is outside `p_num_cb`, the model reports an
invalid-context fault via SGFSR.ICF and returns an error in GPAR. The spec uses a
different encoding where the CB index and VA are packed differently depending on
the register width.

### 4.7 Synchronous TLB Invalidation

TLBSYNC/TLBSTATUS always indicate completion (TLBSTATUS reads 0) because
invalidation is performed synchronously in the post_write callback. Hardware
would have asynchronous invalidation where TLBSTATUS.SACTIVE indicates pending
operations.
